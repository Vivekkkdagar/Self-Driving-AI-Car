# Self-Driving-AI-Car

This project implements an AI-based self-driving car using machine learning, computer vision, and sensor data to enable autonomous navigation. The car is capable of detecting obstacles, following lanes, and planning its path to navigate through a given environment.

Features
Autonomous Navigation: The car can navigate through a predefined path and make decisions based on the environment.
Obstacle Detection: Using computer vision, the car detects obstacles and adjusts its movement to avoid collisions.
Lane Following: The car follows lanes on the road using camera inputs.
Path Planning: The car calculates optimal routes for reaching its destination while considering obstacles and road conditions.
Real-time Decision Making: Using machine learning models, the car makes decisions based on its sensory inputs to drive safely and efficiently.
Technologies Used
Python: The primary language used for model training, control logic, and simulation.
TensorFlow / PyTorch: For building and training deep learning models.
OpenCV: For computer vision tasks, including lane detection and object recognition.
Simulators (e.g., Carla, Gazebo): For testing and training the AI model in a simulated environment.
LIDAR / Camera Sensors: For real-time perception of the environment.

Requirements
To run this project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow or PyTorch
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualizations)
ROS (Robot Operating System) [Optional, for real-time control]
Carla / Gazebo Simulator [Optional, for testing]


Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/self-driving-car.git
cd self-driving-car

Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the simulator (Carla/Gazebo) for testing (if applicable).

Usage
To start the simulation and control the car:

Launch the simulator (e.g., Carla or Gazebo).
Run the car's AI model:
bash
Copy
python drive.py
The car will use its sensors and decision-making model to navigate through the environment autonomously.
